# Feedback App Design Documentation

## Introduction

The Feedback App is a simple React application designed to collect and manage feedback. It offers various features to help users interact with feedback data efficiently. The application utilizes React, state and effect hooks, and context for managing feedback data. Feedback is stored in a JSON Server for persistence. This document outlines the main functionalities and provides insights into the app's architecture.

## Main Functionalities

The Feedback App provides the following primary functionalities:

1. **Add New Feedback:** Users can add new feedback, which includes a rating and a comment.

2. **Delete Existing Feedback:** Users can delete feedback entries.

3. **List All Existing Feedbacks:** The app displays a list of all existing feedback entries, allowing users to browse through them.

4. **Display Average Rating:** The application calculates and displays the average rating of all feedback entries.

5. **Edit Existing Feedbacks:** Users can edit the existing feedback entries, including both the rating and comment.

## Technologies Used

The Feedback App is built using the following technologies:

- **React:** The core framework for building the user interface.
- **JSON Server:** A simple, yet full-featured, fake API to store feedback data.
- **State Hook:** Used to manage the application's state within React components.
- **Effect Hook:** Employed for handling side effects, such as fetching and updating data.
- **Context:** Utilized for managing and providing application-level state and functions to child components.

## Application Architecture

The Feedback App follows a component-based architecture and uses the following key components:

1. **App.js:** The main application component that wraps the entire app. It sets up the context provider for managing feedback data.

2. **FeedbackForm.js:** This component allows users to add new feedback entries. It handles the form input and submission.

3. **FeedbackList.js:** Responsible for displaying the list of all existing feedback entries and handling deletion and edition of entries.

5. **FeedbackStats.js:** Calculates and displays the average rating based on the feedback entries.

## Data Storage

Feedback data is stored using JSON Server. The server is set up in a separate file and runs concurrently with the React application to provide a simple API for storing and retrieving feedback data.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **src**
  - **components**: Contains the React components for the application.
  - **context**: Holds the context and context provider for managing feedback data.
  - **pages**: Contains the React pages for the application.

## Getting Started

To run the Feedback App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Start the React application and Json server simultaneously using `npm run build`.

## Conclusion and Future Work
The Feedback App is a straightforward yet effective application for collecting and managing feedback. To further enhance its capabilities, consider focusing on the following key areas of future work:

1. **User Authentication**
Implement user authentication to enhance security and allow for user-specific features. This would ensure that only authorized users can submit, edit, or delete feedback.

2. **Enhanced User Interface**
Invest in improving the user interface to provide a more intuitive and visually appealing experience. A well-designed interface can significantly enhance user engagement.

3. **Mobile-Friendly Design**
Optimize the app for mobile devices by ensuring it is responsive and user-friendly on smaller screens. This can broaden the app's accessibility and user base.

These three priorities will make the Feedback App more secure, user-friendly, and accessible, setting the stage for a more robust and user-centric application.
